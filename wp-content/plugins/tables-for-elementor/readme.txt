**I've turned the CTA buttons off but they still show**

While in Elementor edit mode you may need to refresh the page for the changes to take effect!

**OK, after a refresh the buttons are gone but now I'm left with a bit of empty space(s)! How can I remove these?**

Switch to one of the Title Settings tabs i.e. First Title Settings and set the Title Margins to 0 or as desired!
